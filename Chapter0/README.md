## Some instructions
Whenever I find something useful, I will update them here. Supplementary material for the specific chapters will be placed in the corresponding folder. Feel free to taste them.

If you find it useful, don't forget to star it.

All comments are welcome.

By the way, I'm new with github. So it would talk some time to get farmiliar with the various operations. Please give me some time.
